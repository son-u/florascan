Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask

Installation Steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/son-u/florascan.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
     cd flower-recognition
   ```

4. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
    python -m venv .venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
  ```bash
      .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  ```bash
    python -m flask --app .\app.py run
  ```

4. Once the server starts successfully, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser
   to access the Flower Recognition System.


### Usage

- Upload an image of a flower to the web application.
- The system will process the image and provide the predicted species of the flower.
